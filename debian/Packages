Description: Debian package archiving tool
 dpkg-repack creates a .deb file out of a package that has already been
 installed. If any changes have been made to the package while it was
 unpacked (i.e. files in /etc were modified), the new package will inherit
 the changes.
 .
 This utility can make it easy to copy packages from one computer to another,
 or to recreate packages that are installed on your system, but no longer
 available elsewhere, or to store the current state of a package before you
 upgrade it.

Description: A terminal spinner/progress bar with Unicode, color, and no non-core dependencies.
 This is a simple spinner, useful when you want to show some kind of activity
 during a long-running process of indeterminant length. It's loosely based on
 the API from Term::Spinner and Term::Spinner::Lite. Unlike Term::Spinner
 though, this module doesn't have any dependencies outside of modules shipped
 with Perl itself. And, unlike Term::Spinner::Lite, this module has color
 support and support for wide progress bars.
 .
 Term::Spinner::Color also provides an asynchronous mode, which does not
 require your program to manually call the next method.
 .
 Some features and some (Unicode) frame sets do not work in Windows PowerShell
 or cmd.exe. If you must work across a wide variety of platforms, choosing
 ASCII frame sets is wise. run_ok method currently only provides Unicode
 output, so it is not suitable for use on Windows (bash, of many types, on
 Windows works fine, however). There's probably a way to fix this by switching
 to another code page in Windows shells.
 .
